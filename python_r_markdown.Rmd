# Python in Rmarkdown

Karan Rao

This is a quick tutorial for running Python code in an R Markdown file. This is especially useful for final projects where students may want to use Python for data cleaning, string manipulation, and even machine learning. This guide isn't exhaustive - it's intended to help you get started immediately and fix some common issues you might find.
